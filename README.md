# yap-yelp
A simple Yelp ( http://www.yelp.com/ ) like business review and cataloging web app with REST API services.

Built using Java (1.7) Servlets and MySQL 6.5 Server. REST API services port out JSON data queried from database like Yelp API for further consumption by other applications or mobile apps.

Screenshots included in Screenshots directory. 

More about this project is discussed on my blog;

REST API JSON output format is inspired from Yelp's API behavior. More about it here;
